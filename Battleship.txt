Landing Page
-------------------
1. Dark Theme
2. Title at the top of the Page
3. Somewhere in the center of the page - 'Single Player', '2 Player'
    3a) if they choose SP, then prompt them to type in there name and have a play button below
    3b) if they choose 2 player, then prompt both players to enter names 1 by 1. After second player enters name, enable the play button
4. Have a link to the source code near the bottom of the page
5. 'Made by Kyle Close' at the bottom of the page 

After 'Play' has been clicked (2 Player)
-----------------------------------------
1. Display a modal. Modal will have the board, Player 1's name, a display of the ship size that is being placed, and a tool tip on how to place.
2. Start with the biggest ship and once 1 is placed we go to the next smallest size.
3. Have an 'Undo' button for when a ship is placed it will pop it off the board and everything will change to now show the last ship that was taken off.
    3a) Unsure if I want to have multiple undo's. Would be nice to have but could be difficult to implement.
4. Have a 'Confirm' button to lock in ship placement. Button will be unable to click unless all 5 ships are placed.
5. Ships cannot be placed next to each other. All surrounding squares are unavailable once a ship is placed there.
6. Repeat this process again for player 2.

After All ships are placed
-----------------------------------------
1. Choose a random player to Start
2. Starting players board is shown on left with their ship placements
3. Opposing players board is shown on right. Opposing board will display all shots that have been taken by attacking player and any hits
4. Beside each players board will be a small 'legend' with the ships (they will be squares. ie. 5 squares for biggest ship) and for each square that has been hit, unlight it (default will be colored in / lit up)
5. Top of the page will display the current players turn.

Gameplay
-----------------------------------------
1. Take turns shooting at any square that has not already been shot at
2. If you hit a ship, you get to go again.
3. If you kill a ship, the squares surrounding all light up (basically they all get shot at)
4. Game is over when a player destroys all opposing ships.
5. When game is over display a victory modal for the winner. Have a 'Return to Menu' button.
